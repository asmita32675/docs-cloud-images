Using images
------------

The Cloud Images service provides basic operations for managing images, such as listing 
and updating images. You can also use tasks to import images to and export images from your 
Cloud Files account. To learn more about the fundamentals of image tasks, see 
:ref:`Asynchronous tasks <asynchronous-tasks>`.

To help you get started exploring Cloud Images, the following examples show some basic 
image operations with cURL examples:
