Sharing imagesÂ 
--------------

The Cloud Images API enables image owners to share images that they have created with 
others and to use images created by someone else. To learn more about the fundamentals of 
image sharing, see :ref:`Image sharing <image-sharing>`. The following examples show some 
basic image sharing operations with cURL examples.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   
	Create an image member <sharing-images/create-image-member>
	List image members <sharing-images/list-image-members>
	Get image member details <sharing-images/get-image-member-details>
	Update an image member <sharing-images/update-image-member>
	Delete an image member <sharing-images/delete-image-member>

.. note:: 

	The user with whom the image is being shared in these examples is identified by a 
	``member_id``, which is the same as that user's tenant_id.
